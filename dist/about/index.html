  <p>This entire project is based off of a meme. However, the system will be adapted to fit my rating system.</p>
<h3 id="about" tabindex="-1">About <a class="direct-link" href="#about" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<h3 id="theater" tabindex="-1">Theater <a class="direct-link" href="#theater" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<h3 id="how-the-ratings-work" tabindex="-1">How the ratings work <a class="direct-link" href="#how-the-ratings-work" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>In true 5/7 perfect score fashion, a 5/7 will denote a perfect score. I will be rating movies on a scale of 1-5 in 0.25 increments(subject to change) based on my 'enjoyment level'*. However, movies will have the opportunity to receive up to 2 bonus points at my discretion for things that would otherwise not bump their base rating up.</p>
<p>For example, the movie <a href="/movies/jerry-marge-go-large/">Jerry and Marge Go Large</a> had a script that stood above the rest of the movie as a whole, for this reason it will be given one of the 2 bonus points, and it raises the score of the entire movie by one point.</p>
<p>* My enjoyment level is a purely arbitrary score that most highly reflects my likelyhood of recommending the movie. For example, the movie <a href="/movies/playtime">Playtime</a> is a classic French film that is often times highly regarded for its beauty. If someone asks me for a movie recommendation out of the blue am I going to recommend it? Probably not, however it still scores very highly due to the fact that I went in knowing what it was and it did what it was trying to achieve. I went into the movie expecting to see a classic masterpiece, I was not let down, and therefore was enjoyed.</p>
<p>On the flipside, I watched <a href="/movies/die-hard">Die Hard</a> with the expectation that I was going to be watching some sort of action movie with a Christmas theme, not to see a classic masterpiece. These can both be rated similarly because they serve different purposes, but they both achieved the same level of enjoyment at the end of the movie.</p>
