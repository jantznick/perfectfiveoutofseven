This entire project is based off of a meme. However, the system will be adapted to fit my rating system.

### How the ratings work
In true 5/7 perfect score fashion, a 5/7 will denote a perfect score. I will be rating movies on a scale of 1-5 in 0.25 increments(subject to change) based on my 'enjoyment level'*. However, movies will have the opportunity to receive up to 2 bonus points at my discretion for things that would otherwise not bump their base rating up.

For example, the movie [Jerry and Marge Go Large](/movies/jerry-marge-go-large/) had a script that stood above the rest of the movie as a whole, for this reason it will be given one of the 2 bonus points, and it raises the score of the entire movie by one point. 

\* My enjoyment level is a purely arbitrary score that most highly reflects my likelyhood of recommending the movie. For example, the movie [Playtime](/movies/playtime) is a classic French film that is often times highly regarded for its beauty. If someone asks me for a movie recommendation out of the blue am I going to recommend it? Probably not, however it still scores very highly due to the fact that I went in knowing what it was and it did what it was trying to achieve. I went into the movie expecting to see a classic masterpiece, I was not let down, and therefore was enjoyed.

On the flipside, I watched [Die Hard](/movies/die-hard) with the expectation that I was going to be watching some sort of action movie with a Christmas theme, not to see a classic masterpiece. These can both be rated similarly because they serve different purposes, but they both achieved the same level of enjoyment at the end of the movie.
